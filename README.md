# Door_Window_Mapper
 Door Window Mapper is a vision-based tool that uses YOLOv8 to detect doors and windows in house images. It saves the results as an annotated image and coordinate file, which are used in a JavaScript web interface. Users can upload, resize, and place new door or window images into detected boxes, enabling virtual fitting for design previews.
